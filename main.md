# Walker Art Center Development Style Guides

Welcome to our style guide for development, as this is being implemented please follow this as closely as possible, and when working on older code try and bring it up to style if possible. These style guides are mainly based upon Google's, which you can view here: [Google Style Guide](google-styleguide.googlecode.com)

The style guides we have are:

* [HTML]()
* [CSS]()
* [Javascript]()
* ~~Python~~
	* ~~Django~~
* ~~Ruby~~
* ~~Bash~~

For preprocessors and template engines, please try and follow the style guides for the final processed language. For example, for SASS/SCSS follow CSS, for Underscore.js templating follow HTML.

When in doubt about style-guides default to the language's style guide if there is one, for example, [PEP 8](http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) for Python, or [JQuery's style guide](http://contribute.jquery.org/style-guide/js/) for JQuery plugins.
